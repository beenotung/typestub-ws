> Typescript declaration for ws@8

Why publish a `typestub-*` package instead of a `@types/*` package?

Because it is not easy to get pull request approved by DefinitelyTyped. (There is already an [pull request](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/55151) opened since 15 August 2021)
